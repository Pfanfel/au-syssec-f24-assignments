### Idea 1:
    use formula:
        $s^e = (s_1 \cdot s_2)^e = (m_1^d \cdot m_2^d)^e = m_1 \cdot m_2 = m \, mod \, N$
        as we can sign random data 
        Questions:
            how is m_1 and m_2 generated? 
                is the main message m just splitted?
            is m_1 \cdot m_2 just a multiplication of the messages? (s_1, s_2)
            How can I test this hypothesis?
